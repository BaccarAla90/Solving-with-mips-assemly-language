# Solving-with-mips-assemly-language
Classic problems solved with mips assembly language.

## Problem one
Write a MIPS program that allows you to select the elements of a source array named Tab by
positive and negative numbers, store them respectively in Tabneg and Tabpos and display the contents
of these two tables.

## Problem one
Write a MIPS program that allows you to copy the elements of a source table Tab1 into a table
destination Tab2 in reverse order and sum the elements of this last table and put the result
in the Somm memory box with on-screen display of this result.

## Problem one
Write a MIPS program which allows to select the elements of a source table Tab1 in even numbers and
odd and store them respectively in two tables Tabpaire and Tabimpaire.

## Problem one
Write a procedure find_b which searches for the letter b in a character string and returns the position of
b in $2 else returns the numbers of the characters in the string.

## Problem one
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number n entered by the user recursively.

## Problem one
